        <h2 style="font-size: 32px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #8CEDD1;">Why Remember Food and Places You Used To Go To / Have?</h2>

        <!-- Subtitle -->

        <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px; text-align: center;">
            The places and environments I grew up in mean so much to me. <br>
            They shaped who I am more than I ever realized at the time. <br>
            We didn’t live in a fancy building and we didn’t go to expensive <br>
            or well known spots, but the small places in my everyday routine <br>
            made the biggest impact. My local supermarket, the people who worked <br>
            there, the schools I went to, the teachers I had and the simple <br>
            moments in those spaces are extremely special to me.
        </p>

        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;text-align: center;">
            I really believe it is important to keep track of the places we <br>
            visit in life. They hold memories that stay with us and they quietly <br>
            help us grow. Even the places that seem ordinary deserve appreciation <br>
            for being part of our story. This section is a way for me to <br>
            thank the environments that raised me and recognize how they shaped <br>
            the person I am becoming.
        </p>

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;text-align: center;">
            Our five senses have this crazy way of teleporting us back to a <br>
            specific moment in our lives. Eating a food that tastes like the one <br>
            your mom made when you were little or smelling the perfume you wore <br>
            in high school instantly pulls you back into that space for a second. <br>
            It is almost like your past self taps you on the shoulder and says <br>
            remember this.
        </p>

        <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
        <p style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px; margin-bottom: 30px;text-align: center;">
            I think that when you are going through changes in life it is <br>
            important to hold on to these little reminders. They help you appreciate <br>
            the versions of yourself that existed during those times. The younger <br>
            you who had a favourite snack after school or the teenage you who had <br>
            a comfort meal during stressful weeks deserves to be remembered and <br>
            thanked. These small details might seem simple but they carry so many <br>
            memories that make you who you are today.
