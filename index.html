    <h2>What Does Nostalgia Means To Me? </h2>
    <h3>Nostalgia : a sentimental longing or wistful affection for the <br> past, typically for a period or place with happy personal <br>associations - Oxford Dictionary</h3>

    <p>
    As I have gotten older, I have felt a new <br> emotion: nostalgia. I think this feeling is often <br>overlooked and under appreciated. As kids, we have nothing <br> to miss because it is our first time <br> experiencing the world. But as the years go<br> by, I find myself holding on to my childhood,<br> my teenage years, and all the things I loved <br>that shaped who I am now. As life keeps <br> changing and everything continues to progress, I think<br> it is important to remind ourselves of the<br> familiar routines, comforting sounds, and small moments that<br> made life exciting when we were younger. Not <br> only to appreciate them, but also to keep <br>creating new memories to feel nostalgic about in the future.
